# 🎓 LearnMate – An Agentic AI for Personalized Course Pathways

## Overview

**LearnMate** is an **Agentic AI system** built using **IBM Watsonx.ai Agent Lab**, designed to guide students in discovering their interests, assessing their skills, and generating personalized learning roadmaps.  
This project was developed as part of my final submission for the **IBM SkillsBuild AI & Cloud Internship** by **Edunet Foundation**.

---

## Problem Statement

Students often struggle to identify the right learning path that aligns with their interests and long-term goals due to the overwhelming number of online courses and a lack of personalized guidance. 

---

## Proposed Solution

LearnMate is an AI-powered Agentic Coach that interacts with students, helps them explore their interests (e.g., Web Development, Cybersecurity, UI/UX), assesses their current skill level, and dynamically builds a personalized course roadmap, adapting over time based on the learner’s progress and preferences.

---

## What the Agent Can Do

- Interact with users to understand interests (e.g., Web Dev, AI, Cybersecurity, etc.)
- Assess current skill level through questions
- Recommend dynamic, step-by-step learning paths
- Suggest top free and paid learning resources
- Answer real student doubts
- Provide interview preparation support
